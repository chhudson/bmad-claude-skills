## Usage Guidelines

**For AI Agents:**
- Read this file before implementing any code
- Follow ALL rules exactly as written
- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option
- Flag if you find rules that seem outdated

**For Humans:**
- Keep this file lean and focused
- Update when technology stack changes
- Review quarterly for outdated rules
- Remove rules that become obvious
