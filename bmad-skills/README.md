# BMAD Skills for Claude Code

A comprehensive skill suite implementing the **BMAD Method** (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) for Claude Code. These skills leverage parallel subprocesses to maximize context utilization across ~150K token windows.

## Quick Start

1. **Install the skills** (see Installation below)
2. **Copy `CLAUDE.md`** to your project root (or use `examples/project-CLAUDE.md` as a template)
3. **Say:** "Initialize BMAD for this project"
4. **Check status:** "What's my BMAD status?"

## BMAD Method Phases

```
Phase 1: Analysis      → Business Analyst, Creative Intelligence
Phase 2: Planning      → Product Manager, UX Designer
Phase 3: Solutioning   → System Architect, UX Designer
Phase 4: Implementation → Scrum Master, Developer, Test Architect
```

## Project Levels

| Level | Scope | Stories | Required Docs |
|-------|-------|---------|---------------|
| 0 | Single change | 1 | Tech Spec |
| 1 | Small feature | 1-10 | Tech Spec |
| 2 | Medium feature | 5-15 | PRD + Architecture |
| 3 | Complex integration | 12-40 | PRD + Architecture |
| 4 | Enterprise expansion | 40+ | PRD + Architecture |

## Installation

### Personal Installation (User-level)

```bash
# Clone or copy to your Claude skills directory
cp -r bmad-skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Project Installation (Team-level)

```bash
# Copy to project's .claude directory
cp -r bmad-skills/* .claude/skills/

# Copy the CLAUDE.md to your project root
cp bmad-skills/examples/project-CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md
# Edit CLAUDE.md to customize for your project
```

### Hook Configuration

Add to your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/hooks/bmad-session-start.sh"
      },
      {
        "command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/hooks/beads-prime.sh"
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/hooks/bmad-pre-tool.sh"
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/hooks/bmad-post-tool.sh"
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/hooks/beads-prime.sh"
      }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "command": "bash ~/.claude/skills/hooks/bmad-session-end.sh"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Beads Integration (Optional)

If you use [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking, BMAD integrates automatically:

**Context Injection (Hooks):**
- **SessionStart**: Runs `bd prime` to inject workflow context (~1-2k tokens)
- **PreCompact**: Refreshes beads context before context compaction

**Story-Beads Bridge:**
- `/create-story` creates both BMAD story documents AND beads issues
- Stories are linked with matching IDs (`STORY-001` → `bd-xxxx`)
- Priority mapping: Must Have=p1, Should Have=p2, Could Have=p3, Won't Have=p4
- Labels added: `bmad:story`, `sp:{points}`

**Ready Work Command:**
- `/ready-work` shows unblocked work by combining beads + BMAD data
- Cross-references `bd ready --json` with `docs/stories/` files
- Displays priority, story points, epic, and sync status
- Works without beads (shows local BMAD stories only)

**Landing Choreography (Session End):**
- **SessionEnd hook** ensures proper session completion
- Runs `bd sync` to flush beads data to JSONL and push to git
- Checks for uncommitted/unpushed changes
- Outputs landing status summary with warnings
- Uses `shared/scripts/landing-check.sh` for verification

**Graceful Degradation:**
All beads integration gracefully skips if:
- `bd` command is not installed
- `.beads/` directory doesn't exist in the project

No configuration needed - just install beads and initialize it in your project.

## Usage

### Initialize a BMAD Project

```
> Initialize this project with BMAD

Claude will use bmad-orchestrator to:
1. Create bmad/ directory structure
2. Set up docs/ for outputs
3. Create workflow status tracking
4. Determine project level
```

### Check Workflow Status

```
> What's my BMAD project status?

Shows completed phases, current phase, and recommended next steps.
```

### Execute Phase Workflows

```
Phase 1:
> Create a product brief for this project
> Research the market for [topic]
> Brainstorm features using SCAMPER

Phase 2:
> Create a PRD based on the product brief
> Create a tech spec for this feature
> Prioritize these requirements using RICE

Phase 3:
> Design the system architecture
> Run the solutioning gate check

Phase 4:
> Plan the sprint from the PRD
> Create user story STORY-001
> Implement STORY-001
```

## Subprocess Architecture

All BMAD skills leverage parallel subprocesses for maximum efficiency:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     Main Skill Context          │
│     (Orchestration Layer)       │
└───────────────┬─────────────────┘
                │
    ┌───────────┼───────────┐
    ▼           ▼           ▼
┌───────┐   ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐
│Subproc│   │Subproc│   │Subproc│
│   1   │   │   2   │   │   3   │
│ ~150K │   │ ~150K │   │ ~150K │
└───────┘   └───────┘   └───────┘
```

See [SUBPROCESS-PATTERNS.md](SUBPROCESS-PATTERNS.md) for detailed patterns.
