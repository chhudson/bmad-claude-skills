## 5 Whys

### Overview

**Purpose:** Root cause analysis - dig beneath surface symptoms to find underlying causes

**Best For:**
- Problem investigation
- Debugging systemic issues
- Understanding user pain points
- Process improvement

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

**Difficulty:** Easy

### How It Works

Start with a problem statement, then ask "Why?" five times (or until you reach the root cause):

1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why does this happen?"
3. Take that answer and ask "Why?" again
4. Repeat until you reach a root cause (usually 3-5 iterations)
5. The final "why" reveals the actionable root cause

### Example

```
Problem: Website conversion rate is low

Why? → Users abandon at checkout
Why? → Checkout form is too long
Why? → We collect unnecessary information
Why? → No one reviewed required vs. optional fields
Why? → No process for form design review

Root Cause: Lack of UX review process
Solution: Implement form design review checklist
```

### Tips

- The "five" in "5 Whys" is a guideline, not a rule - stop when you find the root cause
- Avoid assigning blame - focus on processes and systems
- Can branch into multiple "why" paths if there are multiple causes
- Verify each "why" with data when possible
- Document the entire chain - insights often emerge from the middle links

### When to Use

- **Problem solving:** When symptoms are clear but causes are unclear
- **Process improvement:** When workflows are inefficient
- **User research:** When understanding pain point origins
- **Bug analysis:** When bugs keep recurring

### When NOT to Use

- Complex problems with multiple interacting causes (use Fishbone instead)
- When you don't have enough information (research first)
- When causes are already known (jump to solutions)

### Variations

- **5 Hows:** Flip it - start with a goal and ask "How?" to find implementation steps
- **Branching 5 Whys:** Allow multiple "why" answers, creating a tree structure

## SCAMPER

### Overview

**Purpose:** Generate creative variations by systematically modifying existing concepts

**Acronym:**
- **S**ubstitute
- **C**ombine
- **A**dapt
- **M**odify / Magnify / Minify
- **P**ut to other uses
- **E**liminate
- **R**everse / Rearrange

**Best For:**
- Feature ideation
- Product innovation
- Creative problem-solving
- Generating alternatives

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes

**Difficulty:** Easy to Moderate

### How It Works

1. Start with a base concept (product, feature, process)
2. Apply each SCAMPER prompt systematically
3. Generate 3-5 ideas per prompt (don't filter yet)
4. Document all ideas, even "wild" ones
5. After completing all 7 prompts, review and select promising concepts
6. Combine ideas for even more novel solutions

### SCAMPER Prompts

#### Substitute
"What can you replace or swap out?"
- Materials, components, processes
- People, roles, responsibilities
- Technology, tools, platforms

**Example (Video Learning Platform):**
- Substitute pre-recorded videos → live interactive sessions
- Substitute text quizzes → verbal comprehension checks
- Substitute traditional grading → peer review system

#### Combine
"What can you merge or bring together?"
- Features, functions, services
- Products, offerings
- Processes, workflows
- Markets, audiences

**Example:**
- Combine video lessons + coding playground = interactive coding tutorials
- Combine learning platform + job board = skill-to-employment pipeline
- Combine courses + mentorship = guided learning paths

#### Adapt
"What else is like this? What can you borrow?"
- Solutions from other industries
- Competitor features adapted
- Natural or historical patterns
- Cross-domain inspirations

**Example:**
- Adapt from gaming: achievement system and leaderboards
- Adapt from social media: following teachers and course creators
- Adapt from fitness apps: daily streak tracking and reminders

#### Modify / Magnify / Minify
"What can you change in size, scope, or characteristics?"
- Make bigger, smaller, longer, shorter
- Change color, shape, form
- Amplify or minimize aspects
- Alter frequency or intensity

**Example:**
- Magnify: Create comprehensive bootcamp programs (3-6 months)
- Minify: Create 5-minute micro-lessons for busy professionals
- Modify: Change video format from lecture-style to documentary-style

#### Put to Other Uses
"What else can this be used for?"
- Different audiences or markets
- Alternative applications
- Repurposing byproducts
- Unexpected use cases

**Example:**
- Use for corporate training (not just individual learners)
- Use course content for marketing materials
- Use student projects as portfolio pieces
- Use platform for teaching soft skills, not just technical

#### Eliminate
"What can you remove or simplify?"
- Unnecessary features or steps
- Complexity or friction points
- Assumptions or constraints
- Redundant processes

**Example:**
- Eliminate account creation requirement for browsing
- Eliminate chapters - make courses modular and non-linear
- Eliminate instructor-only content - allow peer-generated lessons
- Eliminate fixed pace - fully self-paced learning

#### Reverse / Rearrange
"What if you flipped or reordered things?"
- Reverse the process or sequence
- Swap roles (user becomes provider)
- Inside-out or backward
- Different arrangement or layout

**Example:**
- Reverse: Students teach each other (peer-to-peer)
- Reverse: Companies create courses for skills they need
- Rearrange: Start with projects, learn theory as needed (vs. theory-first)
- Rearrange: Mobile-first design, desktop as secondary

### Tips

- **Don't judge during generation** - wild ideas spark innovation
- **Set a timer** - 3-5 minutes per letter keeps energy high
- **Generate quantity** - aim for 3-5 ideas per prompt minimum
- **Build on ideas** - one idea sparks another
- **Combine modifications** - "What if we SUBSTITUTE X and REVERSE Y?"
- **Record everything** - ideas that seem silly now may be valuable later

### When to Use

- **Feature ideation:** Generating variations on product features
- **Innovation sessions:** Breaking out of conventional thinking
- **Competitive differentiation:** Finding unique angles
- **Problem solving:** Exploring alternative solutions

### When NOT to Use

- When you need to organize ideas (use Mind Mapping)
- When identifying risks (use Reverse Brainstorming)
- When analyzing strategy (use SWOT)
- When the solution is obvious (don't over-complicate)

### Output Format

```

## Mind Mapping

### Overview

**Purpose:** Visually organize ideas, explore relationships, and structure complex concepts

**Best For:**
- Organizing brainstorming results
- Exploring concept relationships
- System design and architecture
- Hierarchical feature organization

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Difficulty:** Easy

### How It Works

1. Start with central concept in the middle
2. Draw branches for major themes or categories
3. Add sub-branches for related ideas
4. Continue branching as granular as needed
5. Use colors to group related concepts
6. Draw connections between non-adjacent branches
7. Iterate - add, move, regroup as insights emerge

### Structure

```
                    [Central Concept]
                           |
        ___________________|___________________
        |                  |                  |
   [Theme 1]          [Theme 2]          [Theme 3]
        |                  |                  |
    ____|____          ____|____          ____|____
    |       |          |       |          |       |
 [Sub1] [Sub2]     [Sub1] [Sub2]     [Sub1] [Sub2]
```

### Example: E-commerce Platform Features

```
                    E-commerce Platform
                           |
        ___________________|___________________
        |           |           |          |
   Shopping     Payment     Account    Support
        |           |           |          |
   Search      Credit        Profile     Chat
   Browse      Debit         Orders      Email
   Compare     PayPal        Wishlist    Phone
   Filter      ApplePay      Reviews     FAQ
   Sort        Crypto        Settings    Returns
```

### Tips

- **Start broad, go detailed** - main branches first, sub-branches later
- **Use colors** - group related concepts with consistent colors
- **Keep labels short** - 1-3 words per node
- **Show connections** - draw lines between related concepts across branches
- **Iterate freely** - mind maps evolve as you think
- **Use images/icons** - visual elements enhance memory and understanding
- **Don't force symmetry** - some branches will be larger than others

### Digital vs. Paper

**Paper Mind Mapping:**
- Pros: Faster, more creative, tactile
- Cons: Hard to reorganize, difficult to share
- Best for: Personal brainstorming, quick sketches

**Digital Mind Mapping:**
- Pros: Easy to reorganize, shareable, searchable
- Cons: Tool learning curve, less tactile
- Tools: Miro, Mural, XMind, MindMeister, Coggle
- Best for: Team collaboration, complex maps

### When to Use

- **Idea organization:** Categorizing brainstorming results
- **System design:** Mapping software architecture
- **Feature planning:** Organizing product feature hierarchies
- **Note-taking:** Capturing complex information visually
- **Studying:** Understanding relationships between concepts

### When NOT to Use

- When linear processes need mapping (use flowcharts)
- When timing matters (use Gantt charts)
- When generating ideas (use SCAMPER first, then organize with Mind Map)

### Output Format

For text-based mind maps:
```
[Central Concept]
├─ [Theme 1]
│  ├─ [Subtopic 1a]
│  ├─ [Subtopic 1b]
│  └─ [Subtopic 1c]
├─ [Theme 2]
│  ├─ [Subtopic 2a]
│  └─ [Subtopic 2b]
└─ [Theme 3]
   ├─ [Subtopic 3a]
   ├─ [Subtopic 3b]
   └─ [Subtopic 3c]
```

## Reverse Brainstorming

### Overview

**Purpose:** Identify risks, problems, and failure modes by asking "How could we make this fail?"

**Best For:**
- Risk identification
- Quality assurance planning
- Testing assumptions
- Pre-mortem analysis

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Difficulty:** Easy

### How It Works

1. State the goal or challenge
2. Reverse it: "How could we make this fail completely?"
3. Brainstorm all the ways to cause failure
4. List every failure scenario, no matter how unlikely
5. For each failure mode, identify the preventive action
6. Prioritize preventive actions by impact and likelihood
7. Incorporate mitigations into your plan

### Example: Software Launch

```
Goal: Successfully launch new SaaS product

Reversed: How could we make this launch fail completely?

Failure Ideas:
1. Launch without testing on real devices
2. Release with no documentation
3. Ignore all security testing
4. Have no customer support plan
5. Don't test at expected scale
6. Launch with incomplete features
7. Ignore beta user feedback
8. No communication plan for users
9. Launch during holiday season
10. Make it incompatible with popular browsers

Preventive Actions:
1. → Multi-device testing matrix across OS and browsers
2. → Documentation complete before launch
3. → Security audit and penetration testing
4. → 24/7 support team trained and ready
5. → Load test at 10x expected traffic
6. → Feature-complete definition and validation
7. → Incorporate beta feedback sprint before launch
8. → Launch comms plan: email, social, in-app messaging
9. → Launch date review - avoid major holidays
10. → Cross-browser compatibility testing in CI/CD
```

### Tips

- **Embrace negativity** - this is the time to be pessimistic
- **Think extreme** - worst-case scenarios reveal blind spots
- **No filtering** - all failure modes are valid
- **Be specific** - vague failures lead to vague mitigations
- **Prioritize mitigations** - not all failures are equally likely or impactful
- **Follow through** - convert to actionable prevention steps

### When to Use

- **Project planning:** Before starting major initiatives
- **Risk assessment:** Identifying potential problems
- **QA planning:** Determining what to test
- **Post-mortem alternative:** Pre-mortem - identify issues before they happen
- **Assumption testing:** Validating that plans are robust

### When NOT to Use

- When generating positive ideas (use SCAMPER)
- When team morale is low (negativity may worsen it)
- After a failure has occurred (use standard post-mortem instead)

### Variations

- **Pre-mortem:** Imagine the project failed, then ask why
- **Murphy's Law Brainstorming:** What can go wrong will go wrong - what will?
- **Red Team Exercise:** One group tries to break what another group built

## Six Thinking Hats

### Overview

**Purpose:** Explore a topic from six distinct perspectives to ensure comprehensive analysis

**Created by:** Edward de Bono

**Hats (Perspectives):**
1. **White Hat** - Facts and information
2. **Red Hat** - Emotions and intuition
3. **Black Hat** - Caution and critical judgment
4. **Yellow Hat** - Benefits and optimism
5. **Green Hat** - Creativity and alternatives
6. **Blue Hat** - Process and organization

**Best For:**
- Decision making
- Proposal evaluation
- Comprehensive analysis
- Balanced perspective

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes (5-7 minutes per hat)

**Difficulty:** Moderate

### How It Works

1. **Blue Hat First** - Define the problem and process
2. Work through each hat in sequence (order can vary)
3. **Important:** Everyone wears the same hat at the same time
4. Spend 5-7 minutes per hat
5. Document insights from each perspective
6. **Blue Hat Last** - Synthesize and decide

### The Six Hats

#### White Hat - Facts and Information

**Focus:** Objective data, facts, information

**Questions to ask:**
- What information do we have?
- What information is missing?
- What facts are relevant?
- What data can we gather?

**Example (New Feature Decision):**
- 67% of users requested this feature in surveys
- Development estimate: 3 months, 2 engineers
- Projected increase in retention: 15%
- Competitor X already has similar feature
- Cost: $120K development + $30K/year maintenance

#### Red Hat - Emotions and Intuition

**Focus:** Feelings, hunches, gut reactions (no justification needed)

**Questions to ask:**
- How do I feel about this?
- What's my intuition saying?
- What are the emotional reactions?
- What's my gut feeling?

**Example:**
- Excitement about innovative approach
- Anxiety about timeline being too aggressive
- Frustration with current limitations
- Pride in solving a hard problem
- Worry about user adoption

#### Black Hat - Caution and Critical Judgment

**Focus:** Risks, weaknesses, what could go wrong

**Questions to ask:**
- What are the risks?
- What could go wrong?
- What are the weaknesses?
- Why might this not work?
- What are we overlooking?

**Example:**
- Development might take longer than estimated
- Feature complexity could confuse users
- May cannibalize existing feature usage
- Support team not trained for this
- Technical debt created by rushing
- Competitors could copy quickly

#### Yellow Hat - Benefits and Optimism

**Focus:** Advantages, benefits, positive outcomes

**Questions to ask:**
- What are the benefits?
- Why will this work?
- What's the best-case scenario?
- What value does this create?
- What opportunities emerge?

**Example:**
- Differentiates from competitors
- Addresses top user pain point
- Opens new market segment
- Improves customer retention
- Positive PR opportunity
- Team learns new technology

#### Green Hat - Creativity and Alternatives

**Focus:** New ideas, alternatives, creative solutions

**Questions to ask:**
- What are alternative approaches?
- How else could we solve this?
- What creative options exist?
- What if we tried...?

**Example:**
- What if we built an MVP first?
- Could we partner instead of building?
- What about a phased rollout?
- Could we use existing tools differently?
- What if we focused on the 80% use case?

#### Blue Hat - Process and Organization

**Focus:** Managing the thinking process, synthesis, decisions

**Used at start:**
- What are we trying to decide?
- What's the agenda?
- Which hats should we use and in what order?

**Used at end:**
- What have we learned from each perspective?
- What conclusions can we draw?
- What's the decision?
- What are next steps?

### Hat Sequence

**Common sequences:**

**For decision-making:**
1. Blue (define problem)
2. White (gather facts)
3. Green (explore options)
4. Yellow (identify benefits)
5. Black (identify risks)
6. Red (gut check)
7. Blue (decide)

**For evaluation:**
1. Blue (define criteria)
2. White (what we know)
3. Yellow (benefits)
4. Black (risks)
5. Red (feelings)
6. Green (alternatives)
7. Blue (synthesize)

### Tips

- **Everyone wears same hat** - Don't mix perspectives simultaneously
- **Separate the perspectives** - Take breaks between hats if needed
- **No hat is "bad"** - Black Hat critical thinking is valuable
- **Time-box each hat** - Prevents over-analysis
- **Blue Hat facilitates** - Someone should guide the process
- **Document each hat** - Don't lose insights
- **Red Hat needs no justification** - Feelings are valid data

### When to Use

- **Important decisions:** When stakes are high
- **Controversial topics:** When disagreement exists
- **Comprehensive analysis needed:** When all angles matter
- **Team alignment:** When ensuring everyone's voice is heard

### When NOT to Use

- Simple, obvious decisions
- When time is extremely limited
- When facts clearly point one direction
- When team buy-in isn't needed

3. Generate questions only - no answers allowed
4. Quantity over quality - aim for 50+ questions
5. Categorize questions after generation
6. Prioritize questions that need answers

**Key Prompts:**
- "What don't we know about this?"
- "What assumptions are we making?"
- "What would a skeptic ask?"
- "What would confuse a newcomer?"

**Best For:** Early exploration, requirement gathering, challenging assumptions

### Assumption Reversal

**Purpose:** Challenge underlying beliefs to discover hidden opportunities

**How It Works:**
1. List all assumptions about the topic (aim for 15-20)
2. For each assumption, write its opposite
3. Explore: "What if this reversal were true?"
4. Identify which reversals reveal opportunities
5. Design solutions that leverage the reversal

**Example:**
- Assumption: "Users want more features"
- Reversal: "Users want fewer features"
- Insight: Focus on simplification and workflow streamlining

### Key Principles

1. **100+ ideas before organizing** - Breakthroughs emerge in ideas 50-100
2. **Domain pivot every 10 ideas** - Prevents semantic clustering
3. **Quantity over quality in generation** - Filter later, create freely now
4. **Combine techniques** - Use 3-5 techniques per session
5. **Document everything** - Ideas that seem silly now may be valuable later

**Remember:** The best brainstorming sessions feel slightly uncomfortable - like you've pushed past the obvious ideas into truly novel territory. Keep generating as long as possible.
